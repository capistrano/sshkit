**SSHKit** is a toolkit for running commands in a structured way on one or
more servers.

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sshkit.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/sshkit)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/capistrano/sshkit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/capistrano/sshkit)

## Example

 - Connect to 2 servers
 - Execute commands as `deploy` user with `RAILS_ENV=production`
 - Execute commands in serial (default is `:parallel`)

```ruby
require 'sshkit'
require 'sshkit/dsl'
include SSHKit::DSL

on ["1.example.com", "2.example.com"], in: :sequence do |host|
  puts "Now executing on #{host}"
  within "/opt/sites/example.com" do
    as :deploy  do
      with RAILS_ENV: 'production' do
        execute :rake, "assets:precompile"
        execute :rails, "runner", "S3::Sync.notify"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Many other examples are in [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

## Basic usage

The `on()` method is used to specify the backends on which you'd like to run the commands.
You can pass one or more hosts as parameters; this runs commands via SSH. Alternatively you can
pass `:local` to run commands locally. By default SSKit will run the commands on all hosts in
parallel.

### Running commands

All backends support the `execute(*args)`, `test(*args)` & `capture(*args)` methods
for executing a command. You can call any of these methods in the context of an `on()`
block.

**Note: In SSHKit, the first parameter of the `execute` / `test` / `capture` methods
has a special significance. If the first parameter isn't a Symbol,
SSHKit assumes that you want to execute the raw command and the
`as` / `within` / `with` methods, `SSHKit.config.umask` and [the comand map](#the-command-map)
have no effect.**

Typically, you would pass a Symbol for the command name and it's args as follows:

```ruby
on '1.example.com' do
  if test("[ -f somefile.txt ]")
    execute(:cp, 'somefile.txt', 'somewhere_else.txt')
  end
  ls_output = capture(:ls, '-l')
end
```

By default the `capture` methods strips whitespace. If you need to preserve whitespace
you can pass the `strip: false` option: `capture(:ls, '-l', strip: false)`

### Transferring files

All backends also support the `upload!` and `download!` methods for transferring files.
For the remote backend, the file is transferred with scp.

```ruby
on '1.example.com' do
  upload! 'some_local_file.txt', '/home/some_user/somewhere'
  download! '/home/some_user/some_remote_file.txt', 'somewhere_local', log_percent: 25
end
```

### Users, working directories, environment variables and umask

When running commands, you can tell SSHKit to set up the context for those
commands using the following methods:

```ruby
as(user: 'un', group: 'grp') { execute('cmd') } # Executes sudo -u un -- sh -c 'sg grp cmd'
within('/somedir') { execute('cmd') }           # Executes cd /somedir && cmd
with(env_var: 'value') { execute('cmd') }       # Executes ENV_VAR=value cmd
SSHKit.config.umask = '077'                     # All commands are executed with umask 077 && cmd
```

The `as()` / `within()` / `with()` are nestable in any order, repeatable, and stackable.

When used inside a block in this way, `as()` and `within()` will guard
the block they are given with a check.

In the case of `within()`, an error-raising check will be made that the directory
exists; for `as()` a simple call to `sudo -u <user> -- sh -c <command>'` wrapped in a check for
success, raising an error if unsuccessful.

The directory check is implemented like this:

    if test ! -d <directory>; then echo "Directory doesn't exist" 2>&1; false; fi

And the user switching test is implemented like this:

    if ! sudo -u <user> whoami > /dev/null; then echo "Can't switch user" 2>&1; false; fi

According to the defaults, any command that exits with a status other than 0
raises an error (this can be changed). The body of the message is whatever was
written to *stdout* by the process. The `1>&2` redirects the standard output
of echo to the standard error channel, so that it's available as the body of
the raised error.

Helpers such as `runner()` and `rake()` which expand to `execute(:rails, "runner", ...)` and
`execute(:rake, ...)` are convenience helpers for Ruby, and Rails based apps.

### Verbosity / Silence

 - raise verbosity of a command: `execute "echo DEAD", verbosity: :ERROR`
 - hide a command from output: `execute "echo HIDDEN", verbosity: :DEBUG`

## Parallel

Notice on the `on()` call the `in: :sequence` option, the following will do
what you might expect:

```ruby
on(in: :parallel) { ... }
on(in: :sequence, wait: 5) { ... }
on(in: :groups, limit: 2, wait: 5) { ... }
```

The default is to run `in: :parallel` which has no limit. If you have 400 servers,
this might be a problem and you might better look at changing that to run in
`groups`, or `sequence`.

Groups were designed in this case to relieve problems (mass Git checkouts)
where you rely on a contested resource that you don't want to DDOS by hitting
it too hard.

Sequential runs were intended to be used for rolling restarts, amongst other
similar use-cases.

The default runner can be set with the `SSHKit.config.default_runner` option.  For
example:
 ```ruby
SSHKit.config.default_runner = :parallel
SSHKit.config.default_runner = :sequence
SSHKit.config.default_runner = :groups
SSHKit.config.default_runner = MyRunner # A custom runner
```

If more control over the default runner is needed, the `SSHKit.config.default_runner_config`
can be set.
```ruby
# Set the runner and then the config for the runner
SSHKit.config.default_runner = :sequence
SSHKit.config.default_runner_config = { wait: 5 }

# Or just set everything once
SSHKit.config.default_runner_config = { in: :sequence, wait: 5 }
```

## Synchronisation

The `on()` block is the unit of synchronisation, one `on()` block will wait
for all servers to complete before it returns.

For example:

```ruby
all_servers = %w{one.example.com two.example.com three.example.com}
site_dir    = '/opt/sites/example.com'

# Let's simulate a backup task, assuming that some servers take longer
# then others to complete
on all_servers do |host|
  within site_dir do
    execute :tar, '-czf', "backup-#{host.hostname}.tar.gz", 'current'
    # Will run: "/usr/bin/env tar -czf backup-one.example.com.tar.gz current"
  end
end

# Now we can do something with those backups, safe in the knowledge that
# they will all exist (all tar commands exited with a success status, or
# that we will have raised an exception if one of them failed.
on all_servers do |host|
  within site_dir do
    backup_filename = "backup-#{host.hostname}.tar.gz"
    target_filename = "backups/#{Time.now.utc.iso8601}/#{host.hostname}.tar.gz"
    puts capture(:s3cmd, 'put', backup_filename, target_filename)
  end
end
```

## The Command Map

It's often a problem that programmatic SSH sessions don't have the same environment
variables as interactive sessions.

A problem often arises when calling out to executables expected to be on
the `$PATH`.  Under conditions without dotfiles or other environmental
configuration, `$PATH` may not be set as expected, and thus executables are not found where expected.

To try and solve this there is the `with()` helper which takes a hash of variables and makes them
available to the environment.

```ruby
with path: '/usr/local/bin/rbenv/shims:$PATH' do
  execute :ruby, '--version'
end
```

Will execute:

    ( PATH=/usr/local/bin/rbenv/shims:$PATH /usr/bin/env ruby --version )

By contrast, the following won't modify the command at all:


```ruby
with path: '/usr/local/bin/rbenv/shims:$PATH' do
  execute 'ruby --version'
end
```

Will execute, without mapping the environmental variables, or querying the command map:

    ruby --version

(This behaviour is sometimes considered confusing, but it has mostly to do with shell escaping: in the case of whitespace in your command, or newlines, we have no way of reliably composing a correct shell command from the input given.)

**Often more preferable is to use the *command map*.**

The *command map* is used by default when instantiating a *Command* object

The *command map* exists on the configuration object, and in principle is
quite simple, it's a *Hash* structure with a default key factory block
specified, for example:

```ruby
puts SSHKit.config.command_map[:ruby]
# => /usr/bin/env ruby
```

To make clear the environment is being deferred to, the `/usr/bin/env` prefix is applied to all commands.
Although this is what happens anyway when one would simply attempt to execute `ruby`, making it
explicit hopefully leads people to explore the documentation.

One can override the hash map for individual commands:

```ruby
SSHKit.config.command_map[:rake] = "/usr/local/rbenv/shims/rake"
puts SSHKit.config.command_map[:rake]
# => /usr/local/rbenv/shims/rake
```

Another opportunity is to add command prefixes:

```ruby
SSHKit.config.command_map.prefix[:rake].push("bundle exec")
puts SSHKit.config.command_map[:rake]
# => bundle exec rake

SSHKit.config.command_map.prefix[:rake].unshift("/usr/local/rbenv/bin exec")
puts SSHKit.config.command_map[:rake]
# => /usr/local/rbenv/bin exec bundle exec rake
```

One can also override the command map completely, this may not be wise, but it
would be possible, for example:

```ruby
SSHKit.config.command_map = Hash.new do |hash, command|
  hash[command] = "/usr/local/rbenv/shims/#{command}"
end
```

This would effectively make it impossible to call any commands which didn't
provide an executable in that directory, but in some cases that might be
desirable.

*Note:* All keys should be symbolised, as the *Command* object will symbolize it's
first argument before attempting to find it in the *command map*.

## Interactive commands
> (Added in version 1.8.0)

By default, commands against remote servers are run in a *non-login, non-interactive* ssh session.
This is by design, to try and isolate the environment and make sure that things work as expected,
regardless of any changes that might happen on the server side. This means that,
although the server may have prompted you, and be waiting for it,
**you cannot send data to the server by typing into your terminal window**.
Wherever possible, you should call commands in a way that doesn't require interaction
(eg by specifying all options as command arguments).

However in some cases, you may want to programmatically drive interaction with a command
and this can be achieved by specifying an `:interaction_handler` option when you `execute`, `capture` or `test` a command.

**It is not necessary, or desirable to enable `Netssh.config.pty` to use the `interaction_handler` option.
Only enable `Netssh.config.pty` if the command you are calling won't work without a pty.**

An `interaction_handler` is an object which responds to `on_data(command, stream_name, data, channel)`.
The `interaction_handler`'s `on_data` method will be called each time `stdout` or `stderr` data is available from
the server. Data can be sent back to the server using the `channel` parameter. This allows scripting of command
interaction by responding to `stdout` or `stderr` lines with any input required.

For example, an interaction handler to change the password of your linux user using the `passwd` command could look like this:

```ruby
class PasswdInteractionHandler
  def on_data(command, stream_name, data, channel)
    puts data
    case data
      when '(current) UNIX password: '
        channel.send_data("old_pw\n")
      when 'Enter new UNIX password: ', 'Retype new UNIX password: '
        channel.send_data("new_pw\n")
      when 'passwd: password updated successfully'
      else
        raise "Unexpected stderr #{stderr}"
    end
  end
end

# ...

execute(:passwd, interaction_handler: PasswdInteractionHandler.new)
```

#### Using the `SSHKit::MappingInteractionHandler`

Often, you want to map directly from a short output string returned by the server (either stdout or stderr)
to a corresponding input string (as in the case above). For this case you can specify
the `interaction_handler` option as a hash. This is used to create a `SSHKit::MappingInteractionHandler` which
provides similar functionality to the linux [expect](http://expect.sourceforge.net/) library:

```ruby
execute(:passwd, interaction_handler: {
  '(current) UNIX password: ' => "old_pw\n",
  /(Enter|Retype) new UNIX password: / => "new_pw\n"
})
```

Note: the key to the hash keys are matched against the server output `data` using the case equals `===` method.
This means that regexes and any objects which define `===` can be used as hash keys.

Hash keys are matched in order, which allows for default wildcard matches:

```ruby
execute(:my_command, interaction_handler: {
  "some specific line\n" => "specific input\n",
  /.*/ => "default input\n"
})
```

You can also pass a Proc object to map the output line from the server:

```ruby
execute(:passwd, interaction_handler: lambda { |server_data|
  case server_data
  when '(current) UNIX password: '
    "old_pw\n"
  when /(Enter|Retype) new UNIX password: /
    "new_pw\n"
  end
})
```

`MappingInteractionHandler`s are stateless, so you can assign one to a constant and reuse it:

```ruby
ENTER_PASSWORD = SSHKit::MappingInteractionHandler.new(
  "Please Enter Password\n" => "some_password\n"
)

execute(:first_command, interaction_handler: ENTER_PASSWORD)
execute(:second_command, interaction_handler: ENTER_PASSWORD)
```

#### Exploratory logging

By default, the `MappingInteractionHandler` does not log, in case the server output or input contains sensitive
information. However, if you pass a second `log_level` parameter to the constructor, the `MappingInteractionHandler`
will log information about what output is being returned by the server, and what input is being sent
in response. This can be helpful if you don't know exactly what the server is sending back (whitespace, newlines etc).

```ruby
  # Start with this and run your script
  execute(:unfamiliar_command, interaction_handler: MappingInteractionHandler.new({}, :info))
  # INFO log => Unable to find interaction handler mapping for stdout:
  #             "Please type your input:\r\n" so no response was sent"

  # Add missing mapping:
  execute(:unfamiliar_command, interaction_handler: MappingInteractionHandler.new(
    {"Please type your input:\r\n" => "Some input\n"},
    :info
  ))
```

#### The `data` parameter

The `data` parameter of `on_data(command, stream_name, data, channel)` is a string containing the latest data
delivered from the backend.

When using the `Netssh` backend for commands where a small amount of data is returned (eg prompting for sudo passwords),
`on_data` will normally be called once per line and `data` will be terminated by a newline. For commands with
larger amounts of output, `data` is delivered as it arrives from the underlying network stack, which depends on
network conditions, buffer sizes, etc. In this case, you may need to implement a more complex `interaction_handler`
to concatenate `data` from multiple calls to `on_data` before matching the required output.

When using the `Local` backend, `on_data` is always called once per line.

#### The `channel` parameter

When using the `Netssh` backend, the `channel` parameter of `on_data(command, stream_name, data, channel)` is a
[Net::SSH Channel](http://net-ssh.github.io/ssh/v2/api/classes/Net/SSH/Connection/Channel.html).
When using the `Local` backend, it is a [ruby IO](http://ruby-doc.org/core/IO.html) object.
If you need to support both sorts of backends with the same interaction handler,
you need to call methods on the appropriate API depending on the channel type.
One approach is to detect the presence of the API methods you need -
eg `channel.respond_to?(:send_data) # Net::SSH channel` and `channel.respond_to?(:write) # IO`.
See the `SSHKit::MappingInteractionHandler` for an example of this.

## Output Handling

![Example Output](https://raw.github.com/leehambley/sshkit/master/examples/images/example_output.png)

By default, the output format is set to `:pretty`:

```ruby
SSHKit.config.use_format :pretty
```

However, if you prefer non colored text you can use the `:simpletext` formatter. If you want minimal output,
there is also a `:dot` formatter which will simply output red or green dots based on the success or failure of commands.
There is also a `:blackhole` formatter which does not output anything.

By default, formatters log to `$stdout`, but they can be constructed with any object which implements `<<`
for example any `IO` subclass, `String`, `Logger` etc:

```ruby
# Output to a String:
output = String.new
SSHKit.config.output = SSHKit::Formatter::Pretty.new(output)
# Do something with output

# Or output to a file:
SSHKit.config.output = SSHKit::Formatter::SimpleText.new(File.open('log/deploy.log', 'wb'))
```

#### Output & Log Redaction

If necessary, `redact` can be used on a section of your `execute` arguments to hide it from both STDOUT and the capistrano.log. It supports the majority of data types.

```ruby
# Example from capistrano-postgresql gem
execute(:psql, fetch(:pg_system_db), '-c', %Q{"CREATE USER \\"#{fetch(:pg_username)}\\" PASSWORD}, redact("'#{fetch(:pg_password)}'"), %Q{;"})
```
Once wrapped, sshkit logging will replace the actual pg_password with a [REDACTED] value. The created database user will have the value from `fetch(:pg_password)`.

```
# STDOUT
00:00 postgresql:create_database_user
      01 sudo -i -u postgres psql -d postgres -c "CREATE USER \"db_admin_user\" PASSWORD [REDACTED] ;"
      01 CREATE ROLE
    ✔ 01 user@localhost 0.099s

# capistrano.log
INFO [59dbd2ba] Running /usr/bin/env sudo -i -u postgres psql -d postgres -c "CREATE USER \"db_admin_user\" PASSWORD [REDACTED] ;" as user@localhost
DEBUG [59dbd2ba] Command: ( export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.5.0/bin:$PATH" ; /usr/bin/env sudo -i -u postgres psql -d postgres -c "CREATE USER \"db_admin_user\" PASSWORD [REDACTED] ;" )
DEBUG [529b623c] CREATE ROLE

```

Certain commands will require that no spaces exist between a string and what you want hidden. Because SSHKIT will include a whitespace between each argument of `execute`, this can be dealt with by wrapping both in redact:

```ruby
# lib/capistrano/tasks/systemd.rake
execute :sudo, :echo, redact("CONTENT_WEB_TOOLS_PASS='#{ENV['CONTENT_WEB_TOOLS_PASS']}'"), ">> /etc/systemd/system/#{fetch(:application)}_sidekiq.service.d/EnvironmentFile", '"'

```

#### Output Colors

By default, SSHKit will color the output using ANSI color escape sequences
if the output you are using is associated with a terminal device (tty).
This means that you should see colors if you are writing output to the terminal (the default),
but you shouldn't see ANSI color escape sequences if you are writing to a file.

Colors are supported for the `Pretty` and `Dot` formatters, but for historical reasons
the `SimpleText` formatter never shows colors.

If you want to force SSHKit to show colors, you can set the `SSHKIT_COLOR` environment variable:

```ruby
ENV['SSHKIT_COLOR'] = 'TRUE'
```

#### Custom formatters

Want custom output formatting? Here's what you have to do:

1. Write a new formatter class in the `SSHKit::Formatter` module. Your class should subclass `SSHKit::Formatter::Abstract` to inherit conveniences and common behavior. For a basic an example, check out the [Pretty](https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit/blob/master/lib/sshkit/formatters/pretty.rb) formatter.
1. Set the output format as described above. E.g. if your new formatter is called `FooBar`:

```ruby
SSHKit.config.use_format :foobar
```

All formatters that extend from `SSHKit::Formatter::Abstract` accept an options Hash as a constructor argument. You can pass options to your formatter like this:

```ruby
SSHKit.config.use_format :foobar, :my_option => "value"
```

You can then access these options using the `options` accessor within your formatter code.

For a much more full-featured formatter example that makes use of options, check out the [Airbrussh repository](https://github.com/mattbrictson/airbrussh/).

## Output Verbosity

By default calls to `capture()` and `test()` are not logged, they are used
*so* frequently by backend tasks to check environmental settings that it
produces a large amount of noise. They are tagged with a verbosity option on
the `Command` instances of `Logger::DEBUG`. The default configuration for
output verbosity is available to override with `SSHKit.config.output_verbosity=`,
and defaults to `Logger::INFO`.
Another way to is to provide a hash containing `{verbosity: Logger::INFO}` as
a last parameter for the method call.

At present the `Logger::WARN`, `ERROR` and `FATAL` are not used.

## Deprecation warnings

Deprecation warnings are logged directly to `stderr` by default. This behaviour
can be changed by setting the `SSHKit.config.deprecation_output` option:

```ruby
# Disable deprecation warnings
SSHKit.config.deprecation_output = nil

# Log deprecation warnings to a file
SSHKit.config.deprecation_output = File.open('log/deprecation_warnings.log', 'wb')
```

## Connection Pooling

SSHKit uses a simple connection pool (enabled by default) to reduce the
cost of negotiating a new SSH connection for every `on()` block. Depending on
usage and network conditions, this can add up to a significant time savings.
In one test, a basic `cap deploy` ran 15-20 seconds faster thanks to the
connection pooling added in recent versions of SSHKit.

To prevent connections from "going stale", an existing pooled connection will
be replaced with a new connection if it hasn't been used for more than 30
seconds. This timeout can be changed as follows:

```ruby
SSHKit::Backend::Netssh.pool.idle_timeout = 60 # seconds
```

If you suspect the connection pooling is causing problems, you can disable the
pooling behaviour entirely by setting the idle_timeout to zero:

```ruby
SSHKit::Backend::Netssh.pool.idle_timeout = 0 # disabled
```

## Tunneling and other related SSH themes

In order to do special gymnastics with SSH, tunneling, aliasing, complex options, etc with SSHKit it is possible to use [the underlying Net::SSH API](https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md#setting-global-ssh-options) however in many cases it is preferred to use the system SSH configuration file at [`~/.ssh/config`](http://man.cx/ssh_config). This allows you to have personal configuration tied to your machine that does not have to be committed with the repository. If this is not suitable (everyone on the team needs a proxy command, or some special aliasing) a file in the same format can be placed in the project directory at `~/yourproject/.ssh/config`, this will be merged with the system settings in `~/.ssh/config`, and with any configuration specified in [`SSHKit::Backend::Netssh.config.ssh_options`](https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit/blob/master/lib/sshkit/backends/netssh.rb#L133).

These system level files are the preferred way of setting up tunneling and proxies because the system implementations of these things are faster and better than the Ruby implementations you would get if you were to configure them through Net::SSH. In cases where it's not possible (Windows?), it should be possible to make use of the Net::SSH APIs to setup tunnels and proxy commands before deferring control to Capistrano/SSHKit..

## Proxying

To connect to the target host via a jump/bastion host, use a `Net::SSH::Proxy::Jump`

```ruby
host = SSHKit::Host.new(
  hostname: 'target.host.com',
  ssh_options: { proxy: Net::SSH::Proxy::Jump.new("proxy.bar.com") }
)
on [host] do
  execute :echo, '1'
end
```
