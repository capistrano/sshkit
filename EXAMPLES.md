# Usage Examples

## Run a command as a different user

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  as 'www-data' do
    puts capture(:whoami)
  end
end
```

## Run with default environmental variables

```ruby
SSHKit.config.default_env = { path: '/usr/local/libexec/bin:$PATH' }
on hosts do |host|
  puts capture(:env)
end
```

## Run a command in a different directory

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  within '/var/log' do
    puts capture(:head, '-n5', 'messages')
  end
end
```

## Run a command with specific environmental variables

```ruby
# Please see the documentation for caveats related to commands that do not use
# the command map [such as simple strings].
#
# https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit#the-command-map
on hosts do |host|
  with rack_env: :test do
    puts capture("env | grep RACK_ENV")
  end
end
```

## Print some arbitrary output with the logging methods

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  f = '/some/file'
  if test("[ -f #{f} ]")
    info "#{f} already exists on #{host}!"
  else
    execute :touch, f
  end
end
```

The `debug()`, `info()`, `warn()`, `error()` and `fatal()` honor the current
log level of `SSHKit.config.output_verbosity`

## Run a command in a different directory as a different user

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  as 'www-data' do
    within '/var/log' do
      puts capture(:whoami)
      puts capture(:pwd)
    end
  end
end
```

This will output:

    www-data
    /var/log

**Note:** This example is a bit misleading, as the `www-data` user doesn't
have a shell defined, one cannot switch to that user.

## Run a command which requires interaction between the client and the server

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  execute(:passwd, interaction_handler: {
    '(current) UNIX password: ' => "old_pw\n",
    'Enter new UNIX password: ' => "new_pw\n",
    'Retype new UNIX password: ' => "new_pw\n",
    'passwd: password updated successfully' => nil # For stdout/stderr which can be ignored, map a nil input
  })
end
```

## Download a file from disk

```ruby
on roles(:all) do
  puts 'Downloading DB Backup File'
  date_path = Date.today.strftime("%Y/%m/%d")
  download! "/var/mysql-backup/#{date_path}/my-awesome-db.sql.gz", "my-awesome-db.sql.gz"
end
```

## Upload a file from disk

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  upload! '/config/database.yml', '/opt/my_project/shared/database.yml'
end
```

Upload and download will respect the `within()` directories:

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  within 'my/app/directory' do
    upload! 'database.yml', 'config/database.yml'
  end
end
```

## Upload a file from a stream

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  file = File.open('/config/database.yml')
  io   = StringIO.new(....)
  upload! file, '/opt/my_project/shared/database.yml'
  upload! io,   '/opt/my_project/shared/io.io.io'
end
```

The IO streaming is useful for uploading something rather than "cat"ing it,
for example

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  contents = StringIO.new('ALL ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL')
  upload! contents, '/etc/sudoers.d/yolo'
end
```

This spares one from having to figure out the correct escaping sequences for
something like "echo(:cat, '...?...', '> /etc/sudoers.d/yolo')".

## Upload a directory of files

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  upload! '.', '/tmp/mypwd', recursive: true
end
```

In this case the `recursive: true` option mirrors the same options which are
available to [`Net::SCP`](https://github.com/net-ssh/net-scp) and
[`Net::SFTP`](https://github.com/net-ssh/net-sftp).

## Set the upload/download method (SCP or SFTP).

SSHKit can use SCP or SFTP for file transfers. The default is SCP, but this can be changed to SFTP per host:

```ruby
host = SSHKit::Host.new('user@example.com')
host.transfer_method = :sftp
```

or globally:

```ruby
SSHKit::Backend::Netssh.configure do |ssh|
  ssh.transfer_method = :sftp
end
```

## Setting global SSH options

Setting global SSH options, these will be overwritten by options set on the
individual hosts:

```ruby
SSHKit::Backend::Netssh.configure do |ssh|
  ssh.connection_timeout = 30
  ssh.ssh_options = {
    user: 'adifferentuser',
    keys: %w(/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa),
    forward_agent: false,
    auth_methods: %w(publickey password)
  }
end
```

## Run a command with a different effective group ID

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  as user: 'www-data', group: 'project-group' do
    within '/var/log' do
      execute :touch, 'somefile'
      execute :ls, '-l'
    end
  end
end
```

One will see that the created file is owned by the user `www-data` and the
group `project-group`.

When combined with the `umask` configuration option, it is easy to share
scripts for deployment between team members without sharing logins.

## Stack directory nestings

```ruby
on hosts do
  within "/var" do
    puts capture(:pwd)
    within :log do
      puts capture(:pwd)
    end
  end
end
```

This will output:

    /var/
    /var/log

The directory paths are joined using `File.join()`, which should correctly
join parts without forcing the user of the code to care about trailing or
leading slashes. It may be misleading as the `File.join()` is performed on the
machine running the code, if that's a Windows box, the paths may be incorrectly
joined according to the expectations of the machine receiving the commands.

## Do not care about the host block

```ruby
on hosts do
  # The |host| argument is optional, it will
  # be nil in the block if not passed
end
```

## Change the output formatter

```ruby
# The default format is pretty, which outputs colored text
SSHKit.config.use_format :pretty

# Text with no coloring
SSHKit.config.use_format :simpletext

# Red / Green dots for each completed step
SSHKit.config.use_format :dot

# No output
SSHKit.config.use_format :blackhole
```

## Implement a dirt-simple formatter class

```ruby
module SSHKit
  module Formatter
    class MyFormatter < SSHKit::Formatter::Abstract
      def write(obj)
        if obj.is_a? SSHKit::Command
          # Do something here, see the SSHKit::Command documentation
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

# If your formatter is defined in the SSHKit::Formatter module configure with the format option:
SSHKit.config.use_format :myformatter

# Or configure the output directly
SSHKit.config.output = MyFormatter.new($stdout)
SSHKit.config.output = MyFormatter.new(SSHKit.config.output)
SSHKit.config.output = MyFormatter.new(File.open('log/deploy.log', 'wb'))
```

## Set a password for a host.

```ruby
host = SSHKit::Host.new('user@example.com')
host.password = "hackme"

on host do |host|
  puts capture(:echo, "I don't care about security!")
end
```

## Execute and raise an error if something goes wrong

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  execute(:echo, '"Example Message!" 1>&2; false')
end
```

This will raise `SSHKit::Command::Failed` with the `#message` "Example Message!"
which will cause the command to abort.

## Make a test, or run a command which may fail without raising an error:

```ruby
on hosts do |host|
  if test "[ -d /opt/sites ]"
    within "/opt/sites" do
      execute :git, :pull
    end
  else
    execute :git, :clone, 'some-repository', '/opt/sites'
  end
end
```

The `test()` command behaves exactly the same as execute however will return
false if the command exits with a non-zero exit (as `man 1 test` does). As it
returns boolean it can be used to direct the control flow within the block.

## Do something different on one host, or another depending on a host property

```ruby
host1 = SSHKit::Host.new 'user@example.com'
host2 = SSHKit::Host.new 'user@example.org'

on hosts do |host|
  target = "/var/www/sites/"
  if host.hostname =~ /org/
    target += "dotorg"
  else
    target += "dotcom"
  end
  execute! :git, :clone, "git@git.#{host.hostname}", target
end
```

## Connect to a host in the easiest possible way

```ruby
on 'example.com' do |host|
  execute :uptime
end
```

This will resolve the `example.com` hostname into a `SSHKit::Host` object, and
try to pull up the correct configuration for it.

## Connect to a host on a port different than 22

If your ssh server is running on a port different than 22, you can change this is
shown:

```ruby
on('example.com', {port: 1234}) do
end
```

## Run a command without it being command-mapped

If the command you attempt to call contains a space character it won't be
mapped:

```ruby
Command.new(:git, :push, :origin, :master).to_s
# => /usr/bin/env git push origin master
# (also: execute(:git, :push, :origin, :master)

Command.new("git push origin master").to_s
# => git push origin master
# (also: execute("git push origin master"))
```

This can be used to access shell builtins (such as `if` and `test`)


## Run a command with a heredoc

An extension of the behaviour above, if you write a command like this:

```ruby
c = Command.new <<-EOCOMMAND
  if test -d /var/log
  then echo "Directory Exists"
  fi
EOCOMMAND
c.to_s
# => if test -d /var/log; then echo "Directory Exists; fi
# (also: execute <<- EOCOMMAND........))
```

**Note:** The logic which reformats the script into a oneliner may be naÃ¯ve, but in all
known test cases, it works. The key thing is that `if` is not mapped to
`/usr/bin/env if`, which would break with a syntax error.

## Using with Rake

Into the `Rakefile` simply put something like:

```ruby
require 'sshkit'

SSHKit.config.command_map[:rake] = "./bin/rake"

desc "Deploy the site, pulls from Git, migrate the db and precompile assets, then restart Passenger."
task :deploy do
  include SSHKit::DSL

  on "example.com" do |host|
    within "/opt/sites/example.com" do
      execute :git, :pull
      execute :bundle, :install, '--deployment'
      execute :rake, 'db:migrate'
      execute :rake, 'assets:precompile'
      execute :touch, 'tmp/restart.txt'
    end
  end
end
```

## Using without the DSL

The *Coordinator* will resolve all hosts into *Host* objects, you can mix and
match.

```ruby
Coordinator.new("one.example.com", SSHKit::Host.new('two.example.com')).each in: :sequence do
  puts capture :uptime
end
```

You might also look at `./lib/sshkit/dsl.rb` where you can see almost the
exact code as above, which implements the `on()` method.

## Use the Host properties attribute

Implemented since `v0.0.6`

```ruby
servers = %w{one.example.com two.example.com
             three.example.com four.example.com}.collect do |s|
  h = SSHKit::Host.new(s)
  if s.match /(one|two)/
    h.properties.roles = [:web]
  else
    h.properties.roles = [:app]
  end
end

on servers do |host|
  if host.properties.roles.include?(:web)
    # Do something pertinent to web servers
  elsif host.properties.roles.include?(:app)
    # Do something pertinent to application servers
  end
end
```

The `SSHKit::Host#properties` is an [`OpenStruct`](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/OpenStruct.html)
which is not verified or validated in any way, it is up to you, or your
library to attach meanings or conventions to this mechanism.

## Running local commands

Replace `on` with `run_locally`

```ruby
run_locally do
  within '/tmp' do
    execute :whoami
  end
end
```

You can achieve the same thing with `on(:local)`

```ruby
on(:local) do
  within '/tmp' do
    execute :whoami
  end
end
```
